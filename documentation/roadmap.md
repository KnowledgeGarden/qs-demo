# Roadmap
## V1
### Finish DB Schema
### Invent *backside* APIs
### Wire all Services against those APIs
### Wire client to use those services
### Conduct Meta-Quests
Learn as much as we can from invitation-only public quests

## V2
### Implement system design changes based on what is learned from the Meta-Quests
### 
### Advanced Authentication
Most banks and other highly secure websites track your IP address and the browser type. The moment you change IP or browser, they toss you into some form of second level authentication such as texting a secret code or dropping you into a series of questions you chose; the nasty ones of those are sites which require a different answer for each question.  In any case, I (JP) do not believe that simple authentication which is running in V1 will be adequate

### Internationalization
My concern that we should not tie V1 down to this because it will not be used internationally but soon after it gets replaced, it's clear to me that the ability to allow all visual prompts to be according to a user's needs will be critical. This means that Registration will give a list of available translations and require they choose one; if not, default is American English. British English should be an option.

## V3
### Hyperknowledge/OpenSherlock backside

By this time, the platform should be ready for _full daylight_ which means our capabilities should be ready to bring in the vastly more powerful backside, even if its AI functions are not yet fully up to speed.
At issue with this is that the new backside doesn't do what the present design does, so at least we need to think this through. It might be that we must punt that to later versions, but then, that limits the number of guilds a k-hub can host.
