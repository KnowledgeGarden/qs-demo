    <h4>about</h4>
    Sensecraft promotes an ecosystem of <b>Trust</b> and <b>Safety</b>. To
    support that, we enumerate below a minimal set of rules which govern the
    determination of game move behaviors which will be deemed unacceptable.<br /><br />
    These are simple rules, a minimalist set. We expect to improve on them by
    way of public Quests to gain deeper insight into the nature of game
    governance.
    <br />
    <h4>Rules</h4>
    We list the categories of behaviors, as exhibited in game moves, which are
    strictly forbidden.<br />
